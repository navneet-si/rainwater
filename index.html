  <h1>Way Forward</h1>
  <p>
    To replenish India’s depleting water supplies, it is urgent to encourage rainwater harvesting utilizing a combination of ancient rainfall-saving techniques including percolation tanks, injection wells, and subsurface barriers with modern rainwater-saving methods.<br><br>

But relying just on conventional techniques is insufficient. The solution to India’s ongoing water problems may be found in the effective combination of these techniques.<br>

It is necessary to intensify efforts to lessen reliance on groundwater with a focus on improving water security.
</p>
<ul >
    <li>Rejuvenation and replenishment of built-up and natural water bodies.</li><br>
    <li>increased repurposing of cleaned wastewater by neighborhood sewage treatment facilities.</li><br>
    <li>Across both residential and business locations, install properly constructed rainwater collection systems.</li><br>
    <li>Governments at the federal and state levels must work together to enable these initiatives.</li><br>
<li >   For long-term and sustainable solutions, strict policy actions are required.</li><br>
    <li>Local government entities must propose and carry out an integrated water management strategy.</li><br>
  </ul>
