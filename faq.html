        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>1. What is water harvesting?</h3>
            <p>Water harvesting is the process of collecting rainwater or runoff and storing it for later use, rather than letting it run off into the ground or drainage systems.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>2. Why is water harvesting important?</h3>
            <p>Water harvesting helps conserve water resources, reduces the strain on municipal water supplies, and can provide a sustainable source of water for irrigation, landscaping, and other uses.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>3. What are the benefits of water harvesting?</h3>
            <p>Benefits include reduced water bills, increased self-sufficiency, reduced erosion and flooding, and the ability to maintain green spaces during droughts.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>4. What types of water harvesting systems are available?</h3>
            <p>Common types include rooftop rainwater harvesting, where rainwater is collected from building rooftops and stored in tanks, and surface runoff harvesting, where water is collected from land surfaces and directed into storage systems.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>5. How does water harvesting impact the environment?</h3>
            <p>Water harvesting can help replenish groundwater supplies, reduce soil erosion, and create habitats for wildlife by providing water sources during dry periods.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>6. Is water harvesting suitable for all climates?</h3>
            <p>While water harvesting can be beneficial in many climates, its effectiveness may vary depending on factors such as rainfall patterns, local regulations, and the availability of suitable storage options.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>7. Are there any regulations or permits required for installing a water harvesting system?</h3>
